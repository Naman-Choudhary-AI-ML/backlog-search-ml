**Description:** The API Gateway experiences significant latency when handling high throughput requests, primarily during peak hours. Response times escalate from an average of 200ms to 1.5 seconds when concurrent requests exceed 1000 per minute. This delay impacts client applications relying on timely responses, causing timeouts and degraded user experience.

**Steps to Reproduce:**

2. Monitor response times using performance monitoring tools (e.g., New Relic, Grafana).
3. Observe latency increase and resulting timeouts.

**Descrip","**Bug Title:** Cache Layer Performance Issues Causing Increased Latency in Data Retrieval

**Description:** We are experiencing significant latency when retrieving data from the Cache Layer, resulting in slow application response times. Users report that fetching frequently accessed items, such as product details, is taking up to 5 seconds instead of the usual 200 milliseconds. This issue seems to occur mainly during peak hours when the traffic is high. Additionally, the CPU usage of the caching service spikes during these times, suggesting it might be overwhelmed. This delay is impacting user experience and needs to be addressed urgently.",performance,Cache Layer,High

**Description:** After migrating our logging system to the new server, we noticed that several log entries are missing or appear corrupted. Specifically, timestamps are incorrect, and some log messages are cut off mid-sentence. For example, the log entry for user actions on October 10th shows entries from October 1st instead. This issue seems to occur consistently with entries logged during peak hours. The migration process reported no errors, but logs from the last week appear unreliable. This is critical as it impedes our ability to trace important user activities.",data,Logging System,High

When the application is restarted, the Configuration component does not retain user-specified settings, defaulting to initial values instead. This behavior occurs across all user profiles and leads to a frustrating user experience, as personal configurations are lost. 

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Launch the application and navigate to the Configuration settings.
2. Modify any settings (e.g., theme color, notification preferences).
3. Save changes.

**Bug Description:** The Dashboard component allows users to post comments, but it fails to sanitize user inputs adequately. This results in a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, allowing attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in other users' browsers. Upon testing, submitting a comment with `<script>alert('XSS')</script>` executes the alert when viewed by another user. This vulnerability can lead to data theft and session hijacking.

**Bug Description:** The Notification Service crashes intermittently with a NullPointerException when attempting to send notifications to user profiles that have not been properly initialized. This issue arises in the `sendNotification` method within the `NotificationManager` class. It occurs specifically when the user ID is passed as null, leading to a segmentation fault when dereferencing the user object.
