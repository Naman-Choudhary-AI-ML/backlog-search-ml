## 📋 Before Pushing to GitHub

### Step 1: Clean Up Sensitive Files

**Delete these files/folders (contain real data or are unnecessary):**

```bash
# Delete original Philips documentation
rm SPOTLIGHT_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md

# Delete raw Philips data folder
rm -rf BacklogRetrievalApp/

# Delete MLflow runs (optional - contains metadata with "Philips" path references)
rm -rf mlruns/

# Delete Python cache
find . -type d -name "__pycache__" -exec rm -rf {} +
find . -type d -name ".ipynb_checkpoints" -exec rm -rf {} +

# Delete any API keys (IMPORTANT!)
rm -f *.key *_key.txt api_key.txt .env .env.local
```

**OR use this one-liner (Windows PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Delete sensitive files
Remove-Item -Path "SPOTLIGHT_PROJECT_DOCUMENTATION.md" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path "BacklogRetrievalApp" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Remove-Item -Path "mlruns" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Delete cache
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -Directory -Filter "__pycache__" | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
Get-ChildItem -Path . -Recurse -Directory -Filter ".ipynb_checkpoints" | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
```

### Step 2: Verify No Sensitive Data

Run the verification script:

```bash
python check_philips_references.py
```

**Expected output:**
```
✅ NO SENSITIVE REFERENCES FOUND
Repository is safe for GitHub upload!
```

**If warnings appear:** Manually review and remove any sensitive references

### Step 3: Initialize Git Repository

```bash
# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Check what will be committed
git status

# Verify .gitignore is working
git ls-files --others --ignored --exclude-standard
```

### Step 4: Create First Commit

```bash
# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: SpotLight intelligent backlog search system

- Hybrid search (BM25 + Semantic embeddings)
- 48.2% NDCG@10 improvement over baseline
- LLM integration (GPT-4 RAG, duplicate detection)
- Cost/latency/privacy analysis (HIPAA, GDPR compliant)
- Comprehensive evaluation on synthetic dataset

Built by Naman, AI Engineer Lead @ CMU
Targeting MLE/Applied Scientist roles at FAANG"
```

### Step 5: Create GitHub Repository

**On GitHub.com:**
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `spotlight-intelligent-search` or `backlog-search-ml`
3. Description: "ML-powered backlog search with hybrid retrieval (BM25 + Semantic), cross-encoder reranking, and LLM integration. 48% NDCG improvement."
4. **Public** repository
5. DO NOT initialize with README (we have one)
6. Create repository

**Locally:**
```bash
# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/spotlight-intelligent-search.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 6: Update README with Your Info

Edit `README.md` and update:

```markdown
**Author:**
- Name: Naman
- LinkedIn: [your-linkedin-url]
- Email: [your-email]
- Portfolio: [your-portfolio-url]
```

Then commit and push:
```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "docs: update author contact information"
git push
```

### Step 7: Add GitHub Topics/Tags

On your GitHub repository page:
1. Click "⚙️" next to "About"
2. Add topics:
   - `machine-learning`
   - `information-retrieval`
   - `nlp`
   - `search-engine`
   - `llm`
   - `rag`
   - `pytorch`
   - `mlflow`
   - `faiss`
   - `sentence-transformers`

## 🎤 Interview Preparation

### 30-Second Pitch

> "I built an intelligent search system for software backlogs that combines BM25 keyword matching with semantic embeddings. Through rigorous evaluation on 69 test queries, I achieved 48% NDCG improvement using hybrid retrieval and cross-encoder reranking. I explored LLM integration with GPT-4: query expansion degraded performance by 1.4%, but RAG summarization provided 66x ROI by saving users 83 hours daily. I conducted comprehensive cost, latency, and privacy analysis, recommending selective LLM deployment with HIPAA-compliant Azure OpenAI. This demonstrates not just ML implementation, but business judgment and production readiness."

### Key Metrics to Memorize

- **48.2%** NDCG@10 improvement (0.4112 → 0.6092)
- **65x** overall ROI ($4.7K cost → $304K value)
- **83 hours/day** saved (RAG summarization)
- **-1.43%** NDCG with query expansion (FAILED - important!)
- **67%** false positive reduction (duplicate detection)
- **11.2x** speedup with FAISS (8K documents)

### Questions You Can Answer

1. **"Why did query expansion fail?"**
   - Over-expansion with generic synonyms
   - Empirical evidence: -1.43% NDCG, -8.58% Recall
   - Lesson: Domain-specific search needs precise terminology

2. **"How do you measure ROI?"**
   - Quantitative value: 83 hrs/day × $10/hr = $303K/year
   - Cost: $4.6K/year
   - ROI: 66x

3. **"What about privacy?"**
   - Layered approach: Synthetic data, PII removal, Azure OpenAI with BAA
   - HIPAA penalties: $50K/violation
   - Compliance-first approach
